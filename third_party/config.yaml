# Third-Party YARA Rule Criticality Configuration
#
# This file configures criticality levels for third-party YARA rules.
# Uses the same criticality levels as RULES.md:
#   inert      - Universal baseline
#   notable    - Defines program purpose
#   suspicious - Hides intent/crosses boundaries
#   hostile    - Attack patterns, no legitimate use

# Default criticality for all third-party rules
default_crit: "suspicious"

# Per-source criticality defaults

# Uncomment and add specific overrides as needed:
# overrides:
#   - id: third_party/elastic/linux/backdoor/generic
#     crit: "notable"
#     reason: "High false positive rate on pentesting tools"
#
#   - id: third_party/bartblaze/test_rule
#     disable: true
#     reason: "Outdated signature"
