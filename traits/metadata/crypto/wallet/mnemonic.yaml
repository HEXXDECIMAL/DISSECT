# Cryptocurrency Wallet Mnemonic Metadata
# NOTE: This file is disabled - the original patterns were too broad
# Pattern '\b(12|15|18)\b' matches ANY occurrence of these numbers (MAC addresses, versions, etc.)
#
# Proper mnemonic detection requires:
# 1. Context analysis (word list validation, entropy checks)
# 2. Phrase structure (12-24 space-separated words from BIP-39 wordlist)
# 3. Should be in objectives/credential-access/wallet/seed-phrase/ (behavioral intent)
#
# DO NOT re-enable these traits without complete rewrite

defaults:
  for: [all]
  crit: inert
  conf: 0.5

traits: []
  # Removed: word-count-12-15-18 (catastrophically broad - matches version numbers, MAC addresses)
  # Removed: word-count-21-24 (equally broken)

  # Removed: bip39-word-counts (components deleted)
