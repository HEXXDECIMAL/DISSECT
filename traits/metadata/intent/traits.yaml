# Intent Markers - DEPRECATED
# This file has been moved to objectives/anti-analysis/naming/intent.yaml
#
# Rationale: Intent inference is objective-level analysis (attacker goal),
# not metadata (file property). Naming patterns like "backdoor", "rootkit"
# suggest malicious intent and should be in the objectives/ tier.
#
# Migration: All rules moved to objectives/anti-analysis/naming/intent.yaml
# This file kept as stub for backward compatibility during transition.
