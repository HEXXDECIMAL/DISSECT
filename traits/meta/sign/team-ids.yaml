# Apple Code Signing Team Identifiers
#
# NOTE: Team IDs are dynamically extracted with signer names from certificates.
# This file is left minimal - all discovered team IDs will automatically generate
# traits like meta/signed/by/{TEAM_ID} with the signer name as description.
#
# These traits enable ML analysis to learn patterns across different signers and
# identify notable organizations or anomalies.

defaults:
  platforms: [macos]
  for: [macho]
  crit: inert
  conf: 1.0

traits: []
# No hardcoded entries - all team IDs are extracted dynamically from binaries
