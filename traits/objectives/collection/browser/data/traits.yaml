# Browser Storage APIs - Deleted
# This was a taxonomy violation - atomic browser API detection belongs in micro-traits/
# The capabilities now exist at:
# - micro-traits/data/browser/storage::localstorage-get
# - micro-traits/data/browser/storage::localstorage-set
# - micro-traits/data/browser/storage::indexeddb
# - micro-traits/data/browser/analytics::google-analytics-id
#
# For proper collection objectives, combine storage APIs with other
# evidence of malicious intent (exfiltration, sensitive data patterns, etc.)
