# Process Discovery Traits - Deleted
# These simple symbol-based detections were taxonomy violations
# They belong in micro-traits/ as simple capabilities, not objectives/ as objectives
# Capabilities already exist:
# - micro-traits/process/identity/query::get-pid
# - micro-traits/process/identity/query::get-uid
# - micro-traits/process/identity/query::get-gid
# See python.yaml and rust.yaml for proper objective-level process discovery
