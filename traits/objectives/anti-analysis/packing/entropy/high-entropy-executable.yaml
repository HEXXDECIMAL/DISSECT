# High Entropy in Executable Sections
# Detects packing/compression of executable code (common malware obfuscation)

defaults:
  for: [pe, elf, macho]
  crit: suspicious
  conf: 0.85

traits:
  - id: high-entropy-exec-section
    desc: High entropy in executable section (possible packing)
    if:
      type: section
      executable: true
      entropy_min: 7.0
    # Shannon entropy > 7.0 in executable code indicates:
    # - Packed/compressed code (UPX, ASPack, etc.)
    # - Encrypted payloads
    # - Obfuscated malware
    # Normal compiled code has entropy ~5.5-6.5
