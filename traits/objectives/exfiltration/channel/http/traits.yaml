# HTTP/FTP Upload Symbols - Deleted
# This was a taxonomy violation - atomic symbol detection belongs in micro-behaviors/
# The capabilities already exist at:
# - micro-behaviors/communications/http/upload::http-upload-symbol
# - micro-behaviors/communications/ftp/upload::ftp-upload-symbol
#
# For proper exfiltration objectives, combine upload capabilities with other
# evidence of malicious intent (sensitive file paths, encoding, etc.)
