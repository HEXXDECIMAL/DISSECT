# Stealth Node.js Dropper Patterns
# ATT&CK: T1195.002 (Supply Chain Compromise), T1059.007 (JavaScript)
# MBC: B0024 (Downloader), F0011 (Background process)
#
# Pattern: NPM packages that spawn detached Node.js processes to execute
# secondary payloads while hiding all I/O. Common in supply-chain attacks.

defaults:
  for: [javascript, typescript]

composite_rules:
  # === Stealth dropper composite ===

  # Main pattern: detached + stdio hidden + unref = stealthy background execution
  # Complexity: file_types (1) + all (3) = 4 (meets HOSTILE threshold)
