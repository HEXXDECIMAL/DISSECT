# DNS-based C2 and Exfiltration Traits (Node.js) - Composites Only
# Detects DNS tunneling and data exfiltration via DNS queries
# MBC: C0002 (DNS Communication), E1591 (Data Exfiltration)
# ATT&CK: T1071.004 (DNS), T1048 (Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol)
#
# Note: Atomic traits moved to appropriate micro-trait directories:
# - DNS traits: comm/dns/lookup/node.yaml
# - Crypto traits: crypto/symmetric/aes/node.yaml
# This file contains only behavioral composites that indicate C2/exfiltration usage
