# Library Discovery Patterns
# MBC: E1083 (File and Directory Discovery) + T1518 (Software Discovery)
# ATT&CK: T1083, T1518
#
# Code that searches for shared libraries on the system. This is used by:
# - eBPF-based SSL sniffers (find libssl.so for hooking)
# - LD_PRELOAD injection tools
# - Library hooking/interception frameworks
# - Dynamic linker implementations
#
# NOTE: Neutral library paths moved to cap/fs/path/library/
# NOTE: Neutral library names moved to cap/exec/load/library/names
# NOTE: Neutral architecture strings moved to cap/os/platform/architecture/
