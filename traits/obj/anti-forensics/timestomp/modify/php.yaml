# Behavioral composites for timestamp manipulation in evasion context
# MBC: F0006 (Indicator Removal)
# ATT&CK: T1070.006 (Timestomp)
#

# Use that directory reference directly in rules that need PHP timestamp detection.
# No composite needed here - the directory reference provides the same functionality.
