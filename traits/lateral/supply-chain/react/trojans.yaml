# Trojanized React Library Detection
# ATT&CK: T1195.002 (Compromise Software Supply Chain)
# Detects React libraries modified to include malicious capabilities

defaults:
  attack: "T1195.002"
  mbc: "B0024"
  for: [javascript]

composite_rules:
  # React + ActiveXObject = HOSTILE (complexity >= 4)
  - id: trojanized-activex
    desc: "React library with ActiveXObject (trojanized"
    crit: hostile
    conf: 0.98
    all:
      - {id: feat/library/react/library}
      - {id: feat/library/react/version-banner}
      - {id: exec/dropper/activex-object}
    explanation: |
      This file contains React library signatures but uses ActiveXObject.
      Real React never uses ActiveXObject for any purpose.
      This is a trojanized library - a supply chain attack.

  # React + Reverse Shell = HOSTILE
  - id: trojanized-reverse-shell
    desc: "React library with reverse shell"
    crit: hostile
    conf: 0.98
    all:
      - {id: feat/library/react/library}
      - {id: feat/library/react/version-banner}
      - {id: c2/reverse-shell/node/socket-with-exec}
    explanation: |
      This React library contains reverse shell capabilities.
      Real React is a UI library and doesn't create reverse shells.
      This is a trojanized library - a supply chain attack.

  # React + Base64 Eval = HOSTILE (hidden payload)
  - id: trojanized-base64-eval
    desc: "React library with base64+eval payload"
    crit: hostile
    conf: 0.95
    all:
      - {id: feat/library/react/library}
      - {id: feat/library/react/version-banner}
      - {id: anti-static/obfuscation/base64-eval}
    explanation: |
      This React library uses base64+eval to hide malicious code.
      Real React doesn't use base64+eval obfuscation patterns.
      This is a trojanized library - a supply chain attack.

  # React + Credential Access = HOSTILE
  - id: trojanized-credential-access
    desc: "React library with credential access"
    crit: hostile
    conf: 0.98
    all:
      - {id: feat/library/react/library}
      - {id: feat/library/react/version-banner}
    any:
      - {id: cred/browser/chromium/login-data}
      - {id: cred/browser/firefox/cookies-sqlite}
    explanation: |
      This React library accesses credential stores.
      Real React never accesses browser credentials.
      This is a trojanized library - a supply chain attack.

  # React + Command Execution = HOSTILE
  - id: trojanized-exec
    desc: "React library with command execution"
    crit: hostile
    conf: 0.98
    all:
      - {id: feat/library/react/library}
      - {id: feat/library/react/version-banner}
    any:
      - {id: exec/command/shell}
      - {id: exec/command/node/child-process}
    explanation: |
      This React library executes system commands or spawns processes.
      Real React is a UI library and never executes commands.
      This is a trojanized library - a supply chain attack.

  # React + Network Backdoor = HOSTILE
  - id: trojanized-backdoor
    desc: "React library with network backdoor"
    crit: hostile
    conf: 0.95
    all:
      - {id: feat/library/react/library}
      - {id: feat/library/react/version-banner}
      - {id: c2/infrastructure/domain/suspicious}
    explanation: |
      This React library communicates with suspicious domains.
      This is a trojanized library - a supply chain attack.
