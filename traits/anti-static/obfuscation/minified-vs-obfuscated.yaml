# Distinguish Legitimate Minification from Malicious Obfuscation
# Minified code is compressed but readable, obfuscated code hides intent

  for: [javascript, typescript]

composite_rules:
  # Legitimate minification patterns (benign compression)
  - id: minification-pattern
    desc: "Code appears minified by webpack/uglify/terser"

    not:
      - {id: anti-static/obfuscation/base64-eval}
    explanation: |
      This code appears to be minified by standard build tools (webpack, uglify, terser).
      Minification is a normal optimization technique used by legitimate libraries.

  # Hostile obfuscation (malicious encoding)
  - id: hostile-obfuscation
    desc: "Hostile obfuscation techniques (not just"
    crit: suspicious
    conf: 0.90
    any:
      - {id: anti-static/obfuscation/base64-eval}
      - {id: anti-static/obfuscation/encoding/xor-string}
    explanation: |
      This code uses hostile obfuscation techniques beyond normal minification.
      Encoding combined with dynamic execution indicates attempt to hide malicious intent.

  # Minified library with hostile capabilities (trojanized)

      - {id: c2/reverse-shell/socket-command}
      - {id: anti-static/obfuscation/minified-vs-obfuscated/hostile-obfuscation}
    explanation: |
      This appears to be legitimately minified code, but contains hostile capabilities
      that legitimate libraries don't have. This suggests a trojanized library or
      malware disguised as a minified library.
