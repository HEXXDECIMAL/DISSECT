# Known-Good Sample: False Positive Reduction

{{if .IsArchive}}**Archive**: {{.ArchiveName}} ({{.Count}} files with concerning findings)
{{range .Files}}- {{.Path}}{{if .Summary}} — {{.Summary}}{{end}}
{{end}}{{else}}**File**: {{.Path}}
{{end}}

**Your Role**: Security engineer improving DISSECT detection accuracy.

**Goal**: Eliminate inaccurate or misleading detections on this known-benign file while preserving genuinely accurate findings.

---

## Current Status

{{if .HasHostileFindings}}🔴 **Hostile findings present** — These MUST be eliminated. Hostile criticality means unquestionably malicious behavior.
{{end}}{{if .HasSuspiciousFindings}}🟡 **Suspicious findings present** — Review each one. Some may be legitimate for this tool's purpose.
{{end}}

{{if .HasRelatedBadReport}}**Context**: This file also appears in a bad collection. Review malware analysis at `{{.RelatedBadReportPath}}` to understand if the file has malicious variants or was misclassified.
{{end}}

## Your Task

### Step 1: Understand the File

Determine the file's legitimate purpose:
```bash
{{.DissectBin}} strings {{.Path}}
{{.DissectBin}} --format jsonl {{.Path}}
```

### Step 2: Evaluate Each Finding

For each hostile or suspicious finding:

**Is it technically accurate?**
- Does the file actually exhibit this behavior?
- Is the trait detecting what it claims?

**Is it misleading in this context?**
- Is this behavior expected for this tool type?
- Example: Process manager killing processes is notable, not hostile

### Step 3: Fix Strategy

Prefer improving poorly-written traits for better signal than deleting them.

**A. Improve the trait** (preferred - improves precision):
- Some traits are poorly written or incomplete - find ways to address the inaccuracy by improving how it matches programs
- Consider adding constraits like `near`, `count_min`, `size_min`, `for` - see RULES.md for details!
- Upgrade pattern type to a more specific matcher: raw → string → symbol → ast (symbol & AST are the most specific matchers)
- Prefer multiple reusable atomic traits over complex regular expressions (prefer 3 traits over a|b|c regexes).
- Perfect already but in a misleading subdirectory? Move the trait to more neutral directory in taxonomy within micro-behaviors/ or metadata/

**B. Downgrade criticality** (if the finding is perfect, but contextually not suspicious):
```yaml
downgrade:
  - id: path/to/trait::specific-trait-id
    to: notable
    reason: "legitimate use in system administration tools"
```

**C. Suppress with unless** (use sparingly - workaround):
```yaml
unless:
  - id: some-exclusion-pattern
```
Use only when trait is completely inapplicable.

DO NOT EDIT ANY RUST CODE - ONLY .yaml files
Avoid deleting rules unless it's to move them to a better location - prefer fixing them unless they are hopelessly unhelpful.

### Step 4: Validate & Verify

Run `{{.DissectBin}} --format jsonl {{.Path}}` and confirm:

**Required:**
- ✓ Zero hostile findings
- ✓ Zero misleading or inaccurate findings (even inert ones)
- ✓ Suspicious findings ≤1 (acceptable for security/admin tools)

**Quality checks:**
- ✓ Output accurately describes file capabilities - no false positives.
- ✓ No legitimate behaviors completely hidden (prefer downgrade over unless)
- ✓ Context-appropriate criticality (`kill()` syscall: suspicious in game, notable in htop)
- ✓ No trait duplicates (same evidence, same scenario)
- ✓ Inert traits are accurate and not misleading; inert traits that describe a programs purpose should be upgraded to notable

{{if .MayBeBad}}
**⚠️ Misclassification Check**: If analysis reveals this file is actually malicious:
```bash
touch {{.BadMarkerPath}}
```
