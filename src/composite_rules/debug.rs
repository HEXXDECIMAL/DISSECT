//! Debug types for rule evaluation tracing.
//!
//! This module provides types for collecting debug information during rule evaluation.
//! When a debug collector is present in `EvaluationContext`, evaluation records detailed
//! information about why rules matched or failed. When absent (production), there is
//! zero overhead.
